# Bullish Engulfing Pattern Prediction

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the **bullish engulfing candlestick pattern** using machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether the pattern will lead to a positive price movement within 15 days.

## Features

- Historical stock data collection from Yahoo Finance
- Technical indicators: RSI, Williams %R, ADX, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR
- Pattern detection: Bullish Engulfing
- Feature engineering including PCA for correlated price variables
- Models implemented:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks
- Threshold analysis to optimize model performance
- Model evaluation with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Notes

- The predictive models are tools for analysis, not trading recommendations.
- Results should be combined with fundamental analysis and expert judgment when making investment decisions.
